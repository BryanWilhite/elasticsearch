# elasticsearch

## my personal notes on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), a Java thing consumed from a .NET context

>Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time. It is generally used as the underlying engine/technology that powers applications that have complex search features and requirements. [[docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html)]

## Windows install, Chocolatey flavored

Install Chocolatey [package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/jdk8), `jdk8` and make sure `JAVA_HOME` is correct. Based on what is on the [downloads](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) page as of this writing, download the Elasticsearch Zip and extract:

```ps1
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-6.6.0.zip
```

Add `elasticsearch-6.6.0/bin` to `PATH` and run `elasticsearch`. By the current convention, the server should be at `http://localhost:9200/`:

```json
{
    "name": "_RzHa2s",
    "cluster_name": "elasticsearch",
    "cluster_uuid": "Qjz1mRRIS9uDLxtRK776Ug",
    "version": {
        "number": "6.6.0",
        "build_flavor": "default",
        "build_type": "zip",
        "build_hash": "a9861f4",
        "build_date": "2019-01-24T11:27:09.439740Z",
        "build_snapshot": false,
        "lucene_version": "7.6.0",
        "minimum_wire_compatibility_version": "5.6.0",
        "minimum_index_compatibility_version": "5.0.0"
    },
    "tagline": "You Know, for Search"
}
```

## Windows install, bash flavored

In case frustration is found with my previous installation approach, you can get into more trouble by not only installing Elasticsearch in the Windows Subsystem for Linux but also using the Amazon-backed [Open Distro for Elasticsearch](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/) as wellüò¨. There is documentation for [the Debian installation process](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/deb/) and my variation for version 7.1.1 is only slightly different:

```console
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

Ensure that `JAVA_HOME` is set by editing `/etc/environment` with a line like:

```plaintext
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/"
```

where `java-11-openjdk-amd64` is a symlink. For more detail, see ‚Äú[How to set JAVA_HOME for Java?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/175514/how-to-set-java-home-for-java).‚Äùüìö

```console
wget -qO - https://d3g5vo6xdbdb9a.cloudfront.net/GPG-KEY-opendistroforelasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb https://d3g5vo6xdbdb9a.cloudfront.net/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a   /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opendistroforelasticsearch.list

wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss-7.1.1-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-oss-7.1.1-amd64.deb

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install opendistroforelasticsearch
```

Disable _all_ security on the server by editing `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` with these two lines:

```plaintext
opendistro_security.ssl.http.enabled: false
‚Ä¶
opendistro_security.disabled: true
```

For more detail, see ‚Äú[Disable security](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/security/disable/).‚Äùüìö

Finally, because `systemctl` is not really a thing in Windows bash, control the `elasticsearch` service with these:

```console
sudo /etc/init.d/elasticsearch restart
sudo /etc/init.d/elasticsearch stop
sudo /etc/init.d/elasticsearch start
```

‚Äîotherwise, for Linux:

```console
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
systemctl status elasticsearch.service
sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service
```

Verify that the server is running (and unsecured) with these commands:

```console
curl -XGET https://localhost:9200 -u admin:admin --insecure
curl -XGET https://localhost:9200/_cat/nodes?v -u admin:admin --insecure
curl -XGET https://localhost:9200/_cat/plugins?v -u admin:admin --insecure
```

## Elasticsearch is explored through tests

The [Getting Started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html) section of the Elasticsearch documentation is the guide that produces the [tests](ElasticSearch.Tests) in this repo. Here is a rough sketch of the order of tests:

1. `GetServerInfo_Test` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/elasticsearch/blob/master/ElasticSearch.Tests/ElasticSearchTests._.cs#L25)]: verifies the installation
2. `GetServerHealth_Test` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/elasticsearch/blob/master/ElasticSearch.Tests/ElasticSearchTests._cat.cs#L43)]: displays the status of the health of the installation
3. `GetServerClusterNodes_Test` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/elasticsearch/blob/master/ElasticSearch.Tests/ElasticSearchTests._cat.cs#L21)]: shows the status of the default cluster node of the installation
4. `GetServerIndices_Test` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/elasticsearch/blob/master/ElasticSearch.Tests/ElasticSearchTests._cat.cs#L65)]: lists the indices of the node (should return none after install)
5. `PutCustomerInNewIndex_Test` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/elasticsearch/blob/master/ElasticSearch.Tests/ElasticSearchTests._index.cs#L193)]: PUTs (inserts) a new document into an index, generated automatically

Most of the tests come with comments that go into detail (beyond the official documentation) and refer to any dependencies on other tests.

## the `unmet dependencies` error

The `unmet dependencies` error comes from installing `opendistroforelasticsearch` with a version number that is not the same as the version of the packages used with the `dpkg` command. This issue is [detailed on GitHub](https://github.com/opendistro/for-elasticsearch-docs/issues/99#issuecomment-511573544).
